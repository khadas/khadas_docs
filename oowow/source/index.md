## What is OOWOW?

OOWOW is an embedded service (integrated into your device) - it can be run at any time if you need to perform essential maintenance services on your device.

*Note: VIM4 is the first device from Khadas that includes the OOWOW embedded service. Since VIM4 comes without any pre-installed OS, users can use OOWOW to select and install the preferred OS.*

## OS Delivery

OOWOW provides rapid online OS download and installation, which will improve quality of life for single board computer users - with OOWOW, you can install / reinstall your preferred OS in just 2-3 minutes.

## OOWOW Wizard

The OOWOW wizard will guide you to install a new OS in just 4 steps, and it automatically starts if your device storage is empty.

* Connect to internet over Wi-Fi or Ethernet
* Display OS images for your device
* Select OS installation image
* Download and install OS into your device

You can check the [Wizard Usage Example](https://dl.khadas.com/.temp/oowow/screencast/quick-start/-gallery?play=loop).

***Tip: If you need other features, exit from the wizard to the main menu.***
